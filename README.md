#gambit + trebek + Oliver's JS magic = mempoints

A game I created to test your memory under pressure. Can you rack up 2000 points before the time limit is up?

## gambit is a server side application that allows you to design cards and build decks and serve them to a client

## trebek is a clientside library that takes cards built in gambit and serves up an interactive jeopardy game
